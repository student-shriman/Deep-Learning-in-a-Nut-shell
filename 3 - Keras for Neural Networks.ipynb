Thiswill hopefully zoom in to a good set of hyperparameters.

For example, check out DeepMind’s excellent 2017 paper16,where they jointly optimize a population of models and their hyperparameters. Goo‐gle also used an evolutionary approach, not just to search for hyperparameters, butalso to look for the best neural network architecture for the problem. They call thisAutoML,and it is already available as a cloud service. Perhaps the days of buildingneural networks manually will soon be over? Check out Google’s post on this topic. Infact, evolutionary algorithms have also been used successfully to train individual neu‐ral networks, replacing the ubiquitous Gradient Descent! See this 2017 post by Uberwhere they introduce theirDeep Neuroevolutiontechnique.Despite all this exciting progress, and all these tools and services, it still helps to havean idea of what values are reasonable for each hyperparameter, so you can build aquick prototype, and restrict the search space.

    "For many problems, you can just begin with a single hidden layer and you will getreasonable results. It has actually been shown that an MLP with just one hidden layercan model even the most complex functions provided it has enough neurons. For along time, these facts convinced researchers that there was no need to investigate anydeeper neural networks. But they overlooked the fact that deep networks have a muchhigherparameterefficiencythan shallow ones: they can model complex functionsusing exponentially fewer neurons than shallow nets, allowing them to reach muchbetter performance with the same amount of training data.To understand why, suppose you are asked to draw a forest using some drawing soft‐ware, but you are forbidden to use copy/paste. You would have to draw each treeindividually, branch per branch, leaf per leaf. If you could instead draw one leaf,copy/paste it to draw a branch, then copy/paste that branch to create a tree, andfinally copy/paste this tree to make a forest, you would be finished in no time. Real-world data is often structured in such a hierarchical way and Deep Neural Networksautomatically take advantage of this fact: lower hidden layers model low-level struc‐tures (e.g., line segments of various shapes and orientations), intermediate hiddenlayers combine these low-level structures to model intermediate-level structures (e.g.,squares, circles), and the highest hidden layers and the output layer combine theseintermediate structures to model high-level structures (e.g., faces).Not only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good sol‐ution, it also improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. For example, if youhave already trained a model to recognize faces in pictures, and you now want totrain a new neural network to recognize hairstyles, then you can kickstart training byreusing the lower layers of the first network. Instead of randomly initializing theweights and biases of the first few layers of the new neural network, you can initialize them to the value of the weights and biases of the lower layers of the first network.This way the network will not have to learn from scratch all the low-level structuresthat occur in most pictures; it will only have to learn the higher-level structures (e.g.,hairstyles). This is calledtransfer learning.In summary, for many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers andit will work just fine (e.g., you can easily reach above 97% accuracy on the MNISTdataset using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons, and above 98% accu‐racy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly thesame amount of training time). For more complex problems, you can gradually rampup the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very com‐plex tasks, such as large image classification or speech recognition, typically requirenetworks with dozens of layers (or even hundreds, but not fully connected ones, aswe will see in Chapter 14), and they need a huge amount of training data. However,you will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to reuse parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar task.Training will be a lot faster and require much less data "

    "Obviously the number of neurons in the input and output layers is determined by thetype of input and output your task requires. For example, the MNIST task requires 28x 28 = 784 input neurons and 10 output neurons.As for the hidden layers, it used to be a common practice to size them to form a pyra‐mid, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer—the rationale being that many low-level features can coalesce into far fewer high-level features. For example, a typicalneural network for MNIST may have three hidden layers, the first with 300 neurons,the second with 200, and the third with 100. However, this practice has been largelyabandoned now, as it seems that simply using the same number of neurons in all hid‐den layers performs just as well in most cases, or even better, and there is just onehyperparameter to tune instead of one per layer—for example, all hidden layers couldsimply have 150 neurons. However, depending on the dataset, it can sometimes helpto make the first hidden layer bigger than the others.Just like for the number of layers, you can try increasing the number of neurons grad‐ually until the network starts overfitting. In general you will get more bang for thebuck by increasing the number of layers than the number of neurons per layer.Unfortunately, as you can see, finding the perfect amount of neurons is still somewhatof a dark art.A simpler approach is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than youactually need, then use early stopping to prevent it from overfitting (and other regu‐larization techniques, such asdropout,as we will see in Chapter 11). This has beendubbed the “stretch pants” approach:17instead of wasting time looking for pants thatperfectly match your size, just use large stretch pants that will shrink down to theright size."

    "•The learning rate is arguably the most important hyperparameter. In general, theoptimal learning rate is about half of the maximum learning rate (i.e., the learn‐ing rate above which the training algorithm diverges, as we saw in Chapter 4). Soa simple approach for tuning the learning rate is to start with a large value thatmakes the training algorithm diverge, then divide this value by 3 and try again,and repeat until the training algorithm stops diverging. At that point, you gener‐ally won’t be too far from the optimal learning rate. That said, it is sometimesuseful to reduce the learning rate during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Choosing a better optimizer than plain old Mini-batch Gradient Descent (andtuning its hyperparameters) is also quite important. We will discuss this in Chap‐ter 11.• The batch size can also have a significant impact on your model’s performanceand the training time. In general the optimal batch size will be lower than 32 (inApril 2018, Yann Lecun even tweeted \"Friendsdon’t let friends use mini-batcheslarger than 32“).A small batch size ensures that each training iteration is veryfast, and although a large batch size will give a more precise estimate of the gradi‐ents, in practice this does not matter much since the optimization landscape isquite complex and the direction of the true gradients do not point precisely inthe direction of the optimum. However, having a batch size greater than 10 helpstake advantage of hardware and software optimizations, in particular for matrixmultiplications, so it will speed up training. Moreover, if you useBatch Normal‐ization(see Chapter 11), the batch size should not be too small (in general no lessthan 20).•We discussed the choice of the activation function earlier in this chapter: in gen‐eral, the ReLU activation function will be a good default for all hidden layers. Forthe output layer, it really depends on your task.• In most cases, the number of training iterations does not actually need to betweaked: just use early stopping instead.\n",
